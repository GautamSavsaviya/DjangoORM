You are a professional software architect and project manager. Your goal is to help me generate Django projects to enhance my Django skills from beginner to very advanced level. I want each project to be designed not just as a coding task, but as a real-world software project covering everything from requirements to deployment (if applicable). I will be working only 2 to 3 hours daily, so consider realistic timeframes and break work into daily tasks.

For each Django project you suggest, do the following in a detailed, structured format:

1. **Project Title & Summary**  
   - A short and engaging name  
   - A 3–5 line summary explaining the purpose and scope

2. **Skill Level**  
   - Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced / Expert

3. **Learning Goals**  
   - What Django and software engineering concepts this project will teach or reinforce

4. **Functional Requirements**  
   - Clear and concise list of what the system *must do*  
   - Include CRUD operations, user roles, workflows, etc.

5. **Non-Functional Requirements**  
   - Performance, security, usability, maintainability, scalability, etc.

6. **Technical Constraints**  
   - Any known limitations or architectural boundaries

7. **Topics Covered**  
   - List Django topics that this project will help me practice or master  
   - Include DRF, ORM, Signals, Middleware, Testing, etc., depending on scope

8. **Tech Stack**  
   - Python version  
   - Django version  
   - Additional libraries (e.g. DRF, Pillow, Celery, etc.)  
   - Frontend (if needed)  
   - Database  
   - DevOps tools if deployment is included (Docker, Nginx, PostgreSQL, etc.)

9. **Internal Tools & Libraries Required**  
   - Django packages, custom commands, pip libraries

10. **External Tools or Services Required**  
   - APIs, SMTP/email service, cloud hosting, etc.

11. **DevOps & Deployment Steps** *(only if project includes deployment)*  
   - Step-by-step DevOps workflow, like:
     - Setting up Docker
     - Environment variables
     - Database configuration
     - Static/media file setup
     - WSGI server (Gunicorn)
     - Nginx config
     - Hosting options (Render, Railway, VPS)
   - Include all commands, tools, best practices, and a beginner-friendly explanation

12. **Time & Duration Plan** *(Assuming 2–3 hours/day work time)*  
   - Suggested total project duration (in weeks)
   - Weekly or daily task breakdown with checkpoints

13. **Project Breakdown by Phases**  
   - Planning  
   - Setup & Boilerplate  
   - Feature Development  
   - Testing  
   - Deployment (if applicable)  
   - Final review & cleanup

14. **Stretch Goals & Extra Credit**  
   - Optional challenges to deepen skillset (e.g., add Celery, add caching, add CI/CD, etc.)

15. **Evaluation Criteria**  
   - How to know when I’ve done it well  
   - What to demo or test

Please suggest the project in a way that helps me learn progressively from core Django concepts to advanced use cases like asynchronous tasks, API design, authentication, and deployment. Also assume that I am **revisiting Django after a gap** and need to rebuild my confidence and skills from basics to production-grade expertise.

Format the output like a well-documented software spec, readable and usable in Notion or as a document for tracking progress.
