You are a senior software architect, prompt engineer, and project manager. I want you to act like a professional software development mentor building a full skill development plan through projects.

Your goal is to generate a complete progressive roadmap of **Django projects (minimum 10, up to 15)** arranged in order from **basic to very advanced**, where each project helps me progressively master Django and full-stack development. My goal is to become a **professional full-stack Django software engineer**, job-ready for production work.

ðŸ”½ For each project, give a fully detailed spec including:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Project Title & Summary
- A short, catchy project name
- 2â€“3 lines summarizing the projectâ€™s purpose and scope

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Skill Level
- Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced / Expert

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Learning Objectives
- What key Django or software dev concepts I will learn or master

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Functional Requirements
- A detailed list of features and system capabilities

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance, scalability, maintainability, security, etc.

### ðŸ”¹ 6. Technical Constraints
- Any limits in tools, architecture, or design patterns

### ðŸ”¹ 7. Topics Covered
- A precise list of Django topics covered in this project (e.g., models, CBVs, forms, DRF, signals, middleware, testing, Celery, channels, auth, etc.)

### ðŸ”¹ 8. Tech Stack
- Python version, Django version
- Libraries and tools (e.g., DRF, Pillow, Celery, etc.)
- Frontend (if any)
- DB, deployment, and infra (if applicable)

### ðŸ”¹ 9. Required Tools & Packages
- Internal (pip packages, Django extensions, etc.)
- External (email APIs, cloud storage, payment gateway, etc.)

### ðŸ”¹ 10. DevOps & Deployment Steps (if applicable)
- Beginner-friendly step-by-step DevOps guide if the project includes deployment
- Tools: Docker, GitHub, Render, Railway, PostgreSQL, etc.
- Explain even if I have no DevOps knowledge

### ðŸ”¹ 11. Project Duration Plan (based on 2â€“3 hrs/day work)
- Total estimated time to finish the project (in weeks)
- Break it into phases: Planning, Setup, Feature Dev, Testing, Deployment, Review
- Include day-by-day or week-by-week task tracking

### ðŸ”¹ 12. Stretch Goals (Optional)
- Extra features or advanced improvements to deepen learning

### ðŸ”¹ 13. Evaluation Checklist
- How to test my own work
- How Iâ€™ll know when itâ€™s done well

ðŸ§  Final Instructions:
- Start from **simple projects (e.g., blog, to-do, auth system)** and progress to **very advanced ones** like: multi-tenant SaaS, job portals, LMS, notification systems, and real-time dashboards.
- The projects should gradually cover everything: templates, views, forms, DRF, auth, testing, deployment, Celery, WebSockets, APIs, Stripe, Docker, GitHub CI, and more.
- All projects must be realistic and **industry-grade**.
- Format clearly so I can copy the whole result into **Notion** as a checklist and work tracker.

Assume I am restarting Django after a gap and want to master it professionally in 6 months.
