# 🧠 Django ORM & Model Mastery: Level-by-Level Journey

---

## 🔰 LEVEL 1: **Model Design Foundations**

### ✅ Tasks:

* Create the Django project `erm_system` and app `core`.
* Define the following models (only fields + relationships, no `Meta` yet):

  * `Department`: name, location
  * `Employee`: first name, last name, email, phone, hire date, department (FK), manager (FK to self), salary, job title
  * `Project`: name, description, start date, end date, department (FK)
  * `ProjectAssignment`: employee (FK), project (FK), assigned date, role
  * `Task`: title, description, status, due date, assigned\_to (FK), project (FK)
  * `LeaveRequest`: employee (FK), start date, end date, reason, status, approved\_by (FK)
  * `Appraisal`: employee (FK), reviewer (FK), score, review date, comments
  * `Asset`: name, serial number, assigned\_to (FK, nullable), status
  * `Payroll`: employee (FK), month, base salary, bonus, deductions, net salary

### 🎯 What You'll Learn:

* Django model structure
* Fields: CharField, DateField, DecimalField, TextField, BooleanField
* Relationships: ForeignKey, OneToOne, ManyToMany (through model)
* Self-referencing relationships (manager FK)

### 📚 Study Topics:

* Django model fields and syntax
* ForeignKey and related\_name
* ManyToMany with `through=`
* Model relationships in Django
* Django `makemigrations` and `migrate`

### 💡 Suggestions:

* Think like a real business system: how things relate.
* Visualize your model using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) or draw it out.
* Don't overthink constraints yet — just build the skeleton cleanly.

---

## 🔶 LEVEL 2: **Data Seeding with Faker**

### ✅ Tasks:

* Use `Faker` to generate:

  * 100+ Departments, Employees, Projects
  * 100+ Tasks, LeaveRequests, Appraisals, Assets, Payroll entries
* Use `random.choice()` to assign FKs correctly
* Ensure every Project has 3–10 employees via `ProjectAssignment`

### 🎯 What You'll Learn:

* `Faker` integration with Django
* Seeding strategies for related models
* Managing data consistency while generating relationships

### 📚 Study Topics:

* Faker docs: [https://faker.readthedocs.io/](https://faker.readthedocs.io/)
* Django shell and `bulk_create()`
* Data generation for relational models

### 💡 Suggestions:

* Seed models in order: Departments → Employees → Projects → Assignments
* Use `bulk_create()` to speed up inserts
* Track model instance counts with `.count()` to confirm data volume

---

## 🟡 LEVEL 3: **Basic ORM Operations**

### ✅ Tasks:

* Use the Django shell to practice:

  * Retrieve all employees in a department
  * List all projects
  * Get tasks assigned to an employee
  * Count employees per department
  * Fetch all employees hired after a given year

### 🎯 What You'll Learn:

* Basic querying
* Filtering, ordering, slicing
* Forward and reverse FK lookups

### 📚 Study Topics:

* QuerySet methods: `.filter()`, `.get()`, `.count()`, `.order_by()`
* Reverse relationships using related\_name and `_set`
* QuerySet evaluation (lazy vs execution)

### 💡 Suggestions:

* Try same queries in both directions (FK and reverse FK)
* Use `.query` to see generated SQL (advanced bonus)
* Experiment with `.all()` and `.values()` for flexibility

---

## 🟢 LEVEL 4: **Meta Class Usage & Constraints**

### ✅ Tasks:

* Add meaningful `Meta` to each model:

  * `ordering`
  * `verbose_name`, `verbose_name_plural`
  * `unique_together` / `UniqueConstraint`
  * `CheckConstraint` (e.g., end\_date > start\_date)
  * `indexes` on email, hire\_date, due\_date

### 🎯 What You'll Learn:

* How Meta class controls behavior, UI, and integrity
* Field-level and model-level data validation
* Creating performant indexes

### 📚 Study Topics:

* Django Meta options: [Meta documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/options/)
* CheckConstraint, UniqueConstraint
* Database indexing

### 💡 Suggestions:

* Use Meta not only for style but **data safety and performance**
* Use constraints to prevent bad data instead of application logic

---

## 🔷 LEVEL 5: **Intermediate ORM – Aggregation & Optimization**

### ✅ Tasks:

* Count tasks per project using `.annotate()`
* Average appraisal scores per employee
* Sum payroll by employee
* Optimize with `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()`
* Use `F()` to compare base\_salary and net\_salary

### 🎯 What You'll Learn:

* Grouping and calculating with ORM
* Preventing N+1 queries with optimization
* Comparing fields using expressions

### 📚 Study Topics:

* `annotate()`, `aggregate()`, `Count`, `Sum`, `Avg`
* `select_related()`, `prefetch_related()`
* `F()`, `Q()` objects

### 💡 Suggestions:

* Use `select_related()` when using FK fields repeatedly
* Visualize how many queries run with `django.db.connection.queries`

---

## 🔴 LEVEL 6: **Advanced ORM – Subqueries & Complex Filters**

### ✅ Tasks:

* Employees who haven’t taken any leave (using `Subquery`/`Exists`)
* Top 5 departments by project count
* Employees with more than 3 assigned projects
* Latest payroll per employee using `OuterRef` + `Subquery`

### 🎯 What You'll Learn:

* Writing powerful queries without raw SQL
* Using subqueries to filter across related models
* Expressing business logic using ORM

### 📚 Study Topics:

* `Subquery`, `OuterRef`, `Exists`
* `.annotate(...).filter(...)` for conditional logic
* Advanced use of `Q()` and `F()`

### 💡 Suggestions:

* Translate your queries to SQL in your head first
* Use `.values()` with `.annotate()` to simplify testing

---

## 🟣 LEVEL 7: **Custom Managers & QuerySets**

### ✅ Tasks:

* Write custom QuerySet methods:

  * `Employee.objects.active()`
  * `Task.objects.overdue()`
* Chainable queryset filters
* Add business rules in managers (e.g., `.reviewed_this_year()`)

### 🎯 What You'll Learn:

* Reusable ORM patterns
* Keeping logic close to data
* Cleaner code via manager abstraction

### 📚 Study Topics:

* Custom model managers and QuerySets
* Reusability and DRY design
* Django model API chaining

### 💡 Suggestions:

* Think in terms of reusable building blocks
* Replace repetitive filters in shell with manager methods

---

## 🏁 BONUS CHALLENGES

### 🔥 Advanced Mastery Tasks:

* Create a CLI menu script to trigger common queries
* Write performance comparisons between `.all()` and `.values()`
* Add `__str__()`, `get_absolute_url()` to all models
* Write Django tests for your model logic and constraints
* Export a filtered queryset to CSV using a custom command
